in general you need to fuzz the server which can download from here: https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver with fuzz.spk file included here and then try to control the return address in the stack and slide it to your shellcode with nop (\x90) operation.
first of all you nedd to generate a shellcode with msfvenom based your ip with payload of (windows\meterpreter\reverse_tcp) and replace it with my shellcode in the exploit.py,
start a multi\handler session, run the server with humminty debugger and run the exploit, it should work.

you've got an amazing video of John Hammond doing all that at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJF0YPd8lDw&t=2098s
